Take a morning walk of gratitude. It will create a fertile mind ready for success.
Instead of being disappointed about where you are. Think optimistically about where you are going.
Eat. Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a college kid with a maxed-out charge card.
Remember that adversity is not a dead-end but a detour to a better outcome.
Focus on learning, loving, growing, and serving.
Believe that everything happens for a reason. Expect good things to come out of challenging experiences.
Life isn't fair, but it's still good."
